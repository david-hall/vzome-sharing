Standard green zometool struts have pentagonal tips. They can plug into any pentagonal (red) hole in a zome ball in one of 5 orientations, but only one can occupy a hole at a time. In addition, use of a green strut precludes the possibility of a red strut in that hole.

In some cases, it would be possible to use this alternative green strut which represents exactly the same green orbits and lengths as normal green zometool struts, except that it plugs into triangular (yellow) holes instead of the normal pentagonal (red) holes, leaving space for red struts (or another standard green strut) in the pentagonal hole. 

These struts were inspired by Nathaniel's [Equal edged green](https://2lindell.github.io/vzome-sharing/2023/01/22/Equal-edged-green-19-55-05.html) model. It is an example of a design that could utilize these struts to assemble a physical model.

This page is mainly a proof of concept. It's not designed to be 3D printable. It does not have water-tight panel joints or the optimized strut tips from the vZome 3D print starter models.
