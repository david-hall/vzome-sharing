Inspired by John Kostik's [6 axis 15 vZome model](https://john-kostick.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/01/24/6-axis-15-13-42-41.html), 
I attempted to duplicate the model shown in this YouTube video.

I discovered that the trick to rotating a 30-gon prism centered the blue Z axis onto a golden field's red icosahedral axis of symmetry 
is to construct a mirror tool on the plane that bisects the blue and red axes and is perpendicular to the plane formed by them. 
After constructing such a mirror tool, a prism can be built as usual on the blue Z axis, 
then it is mirrored (moved, not copied) onto the red axis and then tetrahedral symmetry is applied to it.
The result is a set of 6 prisms, each on one of the 6 axes of icosahedral symmetry 
even though the vZome 30-gon field does not (yet) support icosahedral symmetry.

I chose the 30-gon field to match the design in the YouTube video, but this general technique of applying a mirror can conceptually be applied to any 10N-gon field. 
It can not be applied to odd 5N-gon fields because the antiprism symmetry in those fields uses embedding, but the red axis from icosahedral symmetry does not.
