A 3D design created in vZome.  Turn off perspective for best results.

Sorry, I got too ambitious with this lattice and killed the performance. 
Please just be patient for now when it's first loading or when you change scenes. 
I'll post a simpler more responsive version in a few days.

The lattice itself is composed of one affine Soccer ball in 4 differnt orientations. 
The `Initial 4 Balls` scene initially appears to have tetrahedral symmetry, but it doesn't. 
It just has a couple of perpendicular mirror symmetries that may not be initially obvious.

The lattice is not exactly the standard diamond lattice made with `yellow` vZome struts. 
It's topologiclly equivalent, but it's struts unepectedly are in a slightly differnt direction 
from the typical symmetrical diamond lattice.
