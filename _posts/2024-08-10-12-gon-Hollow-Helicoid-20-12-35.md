**Quadrilateral faces on a Helicoid surface**

Unlike my [previous helocoid design](https://david-hall.github.io/vzome-sharing/2024/07/19/18-gon-Rhombic-Helicoid-01-34-46.html) 
which is constructed from thin tetrahedra joined edge to edge, thus having some "thickness", this one is made of a single layer of quadrilaterals.
Those quadrilaterals on the edges of the helocoid are bisected diagonally so the resulting triangles will smooth the internal and external edges of the helicoid. 
This particular design is also hollow since the surface is not extended to the central axis. On any plane orthogonal to the axis, the corresponding spiral can be extended ad infinitum.
In this design, I chose to stop at a single revolition of the underlying spiral.
