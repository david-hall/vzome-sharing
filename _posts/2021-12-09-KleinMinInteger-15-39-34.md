The current vZome desktop (7.81) and online viewer (version 52) do not render non-convex panels correctly as in the first model below. The much older vZome desktop (version 6) does render them correctly.

A second problem shows up in the second model shown below. The final built-in `tetrahedral symmetry` command does not copy the panel colors as it should. I suspect that it's because the model was made with version 7.66 
before the `copyColors` property was added and the newer versions of vZome desktop probably incorrectly default to `copyColors="false"` for these tools when the property isn't found.
The model renders correctly online because the shapes.json file has the correct colors specified because it was generated by the earlier version of desktop.

The initial problem regarding non-convex panels shows up because of the way vZome 7 slices panels into triangles for rendering. It presumes that they are always convex. 
This is usually true and the assumption allows for more efficient code for slicing of the panel into triangles as long as the assumption really is true, 
but for the occasional non-convex cases the obvious side effect is that the panel can render some unexpected artifacts which extend beyond its intended outline as seen here.

The recommended solution is to replace every individual non-convex panel with multiple convex panels as in the second model below. While this avoids the problem with the artifacts, it introduces two new problems for the model's author. 

First of all, the outline of the panel is intended to surround only the orignal non-convex panel, not each of the constituent convex panels. This issue only shows up in desktop since online doesn't render outlines at all. 

Secondly, the original non-convex panel normally constitutes an entire single facet of the polyhedron. 
By modeling it from discreet convex panels, they need to be individually selected to manipulate them, or else grouped, which is an additional step that pushes unnecessary complexity to the model author 
when vZome core should be able to handle non-convex panels.
