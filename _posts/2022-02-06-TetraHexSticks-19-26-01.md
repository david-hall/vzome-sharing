__*Edit 7/11/2022*__
I'm not sure exactly when this bug was fixed, but as of today, it appears to be resolved. The following post describes the problem as it was originally reported.

This model renders correctly in vZome desktop and in the vZome viewer, but several of the red and yellow panels are incorrectly shown as green in [vZome online](https://www.vzome.com/app/).

As can be seen in the history, some of the `SelectionManifestation` edits are not actually selecting the intended panels before `setItemColor` colors them red or before `MapToColor-CopyLastSelectedColor` colors them yellow.

A possibly related issue can be seen within the `ChangeSelection` branch immediately prior to coloring the red panels where _none_ of the parameters for _any_ of the `SelectionManifestation` edits are shown at the bottom of the history pane. This occurs when the correct panels actually get selected as well as when the `SelectionManifestation` fails to select any panel.

The `SelectionManifestation` parameters are also missing from the history pane in several prior instances though they don't appear to impact the model. For example, the last `SelectionManifestation` before the `ConvexHull3d` as well as some other instances earlier in the history don't show their parameters.

__*Edit 2/6/2022*__
After reviewing the vZome file, I realize that the instances of `SelectionManifestation` that don't show their parameters at the bottom of the history pane are all selections of panels. Panel selection parameters are stored as XML child nodes whereas ball and strut selection parameters are stored as XML attributes. That probably accounts for the panel parameters not showing up in the history panel. However, the problem of some panels not being selected prior to the color change commands is still an unresolved bug.

The vZome model can be downloaded from the viewer below or opened from [https://david-hall.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/02/06/19-26-01-TetraHexSticks/TetraHexSticks.vZome](https://david-hall.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/02/06/19-26-01-TetraHexSticks/TetraHexSticks.vZome).
