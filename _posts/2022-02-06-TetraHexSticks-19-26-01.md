__{{ page.description }}__

This model renders correctly in vZome desktop and in the vZome viewer, but several of the red and yellow panels are incorrectly shown as green in [vZome online](https://www.vzome.com/app/).

As can be seen in the history, some of the `SelectionManifestation` edits are not actually selecting the intended panels before `setItemColor` colors them red or before `MapToColor/CopyLastSelectedColor' colors them yellow.

A possibly related issue can be seen within the ChangeSelection branch immediately prior to coloring the red panels, none of the parameters for _any_ of the `SelectionManifestation` edits are shown at the bottom of the history pane. This occurs when the correct panels actually get selected as well as when the `SelectionManifestation` fails to select any panel.

The `SelectionManifestation` parameters are also missing from the history pane in several prior instances though they don't appear to impact the model. For example, the last `SelectionManifestation` before the `ConvexHull3d` as well as some other instances earlier in the history don't show their parameters.

The vZome model can be downloaded from the viewer or opened from [https://david-hall.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/02/06/19-26-01-TetraHexSticks/TetraHexSticks.vZome](https://david-hall.github.io/vzome-sharing/2022/02/06/19-26-01-TetraHexSticks/TetraHexSticks.vZome).
