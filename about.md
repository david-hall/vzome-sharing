This webpage is generated by [GitHub Pages][pages] from my 'vzome-sharing' [source repository][source].
Much of the content in the repository is generated by [vZome][vzome], a desktop app for designing geometric shapes,
with specific support for shapes that can be constructed with [Zometool][zometool]. With vZome any design can be
shared as a page, if you have a 'vzome-sharing' GitHub repository and you've followed the [configuration instructions][help].
